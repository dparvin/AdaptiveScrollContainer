## ✨ AdaptiveScrollContainer Overview

AdaptiveScrollContainer is a cross-platform container control that dynamically adapts its layout behavior based on available space.

- 🧱 **Acts like a normal container** until a defined transition point.  
- 🖱️ **Scrollbars appear automatically** when the container becomes smaller than the specified threshold.  
- ⚡ **Smart focus handling:** Ensures that the control with focus always remains visible.  
- 📐 **Supports nested containers** — each with independent adaptive behavior.  
- 🧍 **Cross-platform roadmap:** WinForms → WPF → iOS (and possibly MAUI, UWP, and web).
